# The files in this directory are interpreted by portage-bashrc-mv, see
# https://github.com/vaeth/portage-bashrc-mv/
# An ebuild for the latter is in the mv overlay (available over layman).
#
# The syntax of the files in this directory is described in
# /etc/portage/bashrc.d/README*
# when you installed the above by the ebuild. Otherwise you might try
# https://github.com/vaeth/portage-bashrc-mv/raw/master/bashrc.d/README
#
# Although in principle anything could go in any file of this directory,
# the files are somewhat ordered:
#
# all-systems
#     This is the main file for resetting C*FLAGS which might be set in
#     /etc/portage/make.conf/* and which are too aggressive for some packages
# checks
#     Packages breaking with -fno-common (without -fcommon in >=gcc-10) or
#     -Wl,--no-undefined. These breakages might indicate a hidden bug
# flto
#     The same for LTO related flags like e.g.
#     -flto -fwhole-program -fuse-linker-plugin -emit-llvm -flto-partition=none
#     -flto-odr-type-merging"
# gcc-6
#     Some patches which allow compilation with >=gcc-6
# gold
#     Some patches which allow compilation with the gold linker
# graphite
#     graphite related flags; this file is currently unmaintained
# lowmem
#     This file should be only used when you run a system with <200 MB;
#     otherwise remove it...
# no-add
#     Packages requiring NOLDADD=1 or even MESONDEDUP=1
# no-ninja
#     Packages breaking with CMAKE_MAKEFILE_GENERATOR="ninja"
# patches
#     Instead of using patches to fix bugs, sometimes it suffices to set
#     environment variables or compiler options. If possible this happens in
#     this file.
# pie
#     For packages which break with -fPIE -pie or without -fno-PIE -no-pie
# spectre
#     For packages which break with spectre mitigation flags like
#    -fno-plt -mindirect-branch=thunk -mindirect-branch-register
#    -mfunction-return=thunk -Wl,-z,retpolineplt -mretpoline
# temporary
#     As the name says: entries which are expected to be removed soon but
#     which might be currently necessary for some reason or another...

# In case of compilation/build errors, some of the following usually help
# (The sorting is in decreasing order of probability of causing trouble;
# for "undefined reference" errors, +Wl,--as-needed is the top candidate,
# followed NOLDADD=1 (or MESONDEDUP=1 for packages using meson).
# To make sure, the problem actually stems from flags, you can try first SAFE
# [hack on the command line: FLAG_ADD=SAFE emerge ...] to eliminate everything).
#
# "unset CMAKE_MAKEFILE_GENERATOR"
#  e.g. for endless compilation: these are collected in an extra file:
#   /etc/portage/package.cflags/no-ninja
#
# +flto* (or the subset +fuse-linker-plugin +fwhole-program -ffat-lto-objects)
#  these are collected in an extra file: flto
#   Typical error on 32bit: /usr/include/bits/stdio2.h: internal compiler error
#   Typical error: syntax error near unexpected token `|'
#   Typical error: ... .flto. ....
#   Typical error: undefined symbol
#   Typical error: reallocation
# +fPIE +pie
#  these are collected in an extra file: pie
#   Typical error on 32bit: hang with "corrupted double-linked list"
#   Typical error: undefined reference to `main'
#   Typical error: undefined symbol
#   Typical error: recompile with -fPIC
# +fno-common
#   Typical error: multiple definition
# +Wl,--no-undefined # Using this might hide starttime/runtime issues
#   Typical error: undefined reference to '...'
# +fgraphite* +floop-*
#  these are collected in an extra file: /etc/portage/package.cflags/graphite
#   Typical error: segfaults
#   Typical error: internal compiler error
# +ftree-loop-distribute-patterns
#   Typical error: undefined reference to `memset'
# +fno-plt
# +mindirect-branch*
# +mfunction-return*
# +mretpoline # clang only
# +fcf-protection* # gcc-8
# +Wl,-z,retpolineplt # currently clang only
# NOLDADD=1 (or even MESONDEDUP=1)
# NOLDOPT=1 (might be a security risk)
# +fdiagnostics-color=always
# MAKEOPTS-='--no-print-directory'
# +D*FILE*
# +D*DEBUG +D*ASSERT
# +D*FORTIFY* -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE (the latter is sometimes also in the ebuild)
# +Wl,--as-needed LD_AS_NEEDED=
# +frename-registers
# +fvisibility-inlines-hidden
#  Typical error: "recompile with -fPIC" on amd64
# +fdirectives-only
#  Typical error: __COUNTER__ expanded
# +freorder-functions
# +fdevirtualize-speculatively
# +ftree-partial-pre
# +g0
# +Wl,--relax
# +Wl,--hash-style=gnu -Wl,--hash-style=both
# +Wl,-z,relro # is a security risk
# +finline-functions
# +s +Wl,-S
# +Wl,--enable-new-dtags
# +Wl,--combreloc
#
# Patches like the following go into a separate file "patches":
# EXTRA_EMAKE+='SHELL=/bin/bash'
#
# The following may be related if you specify a restrictive CONFIG_SITE=;
# see also the comments in config.site
# (Patches like the following go into a separate file "patches")
# EXTRA_ECONF-='*disable-static' 'export enable_static=yes'
# EXTRA_ECONF-='*silent-rules' 'export enable_silent_rules=no'
# EXTRA_ECONF-='*dependency-tracking' 'export disable_dependency_tracking=1'
# 'export enable_fast_install=no'
#
# For non-reproducible errors, the usual solution is to disable parallel make:
# MAKEOPTS-='-j*'
#
# In case of runtime errors (e.g. segfaults), try first recompiling with
# SAFE -flifetime-dse=1 -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks -fno-PIE -no-pie
#
# which eliminates everything. (Note however that especially large file support
# should better be *added* if libraries use it, and that not using -Wl,-z,now
# might be insecure, at least for SUID programs.)
#
# If SAFE helps, you can try binary search to find the actual cause
# (by the remarks above you should really do this).
# Here are the candidates in decreasing order of probability by experience:
#
# +ftree-vectorize* +fvect* [or add -mstackrealign]
# +flto* (see above; there is an extra file)
# NOLDADD=1 (or even MESONDEDUP=1)
# NOLDOPT=1 (might be a security risk)
# CONFIG_SITE=
# +D*FILE*
# +D*DEBUG +D*ASSERT
# +*math*
# +fvisibility-inlines-hidden
# +fno-enforce-eh-specs
# +fnothrow-opt
# +Wl,--as-needed LD_AS_NEEDED=
# +D*FORTIFY* -U_FORTIFY_SOURCE (the latter is not always necessary)
